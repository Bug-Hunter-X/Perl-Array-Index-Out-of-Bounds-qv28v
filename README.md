This repository demonstrates a common error in Perl: accessing an array element beyond its bounds. The `bug.pl` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.pl` provides the corrected version.  The error arises from the misunderstanding of Perl's zero-based indexing system.  Always ensure you validate array indices before accessing elements to avoid unexpected undef values.
